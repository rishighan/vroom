Conservative and High Church Anglican, most of Dodgson's ancestors were army officers or Church of England clergy. His great-grandfather, also named Charles Dodgson, had risen through the ranks of the church to become the Bishop of Elphin.[4] \r\n\r\nHis paternal grandfather, another Charles, had been an army captain, killed in action in Ireland in 1803 when his two sons were hardly more than babies.[5] The oldest of these sons – yet another Charles Dodgson – was Carroll's father. He reverted to the other family tradition and took holy orders. He went to Westminster School, and then to Christ Church, Oxford. He was mathematically gifted and won a double first degree, which could have been the prelude to a brilliant academic career. Instead he married his first cousin, Frances Jane Lutwidge,[6] in 1827 and became a country parson."], ["created_at", Wed, 11 Jun 2014 16:17:42 UTC +00:00], ["excerpt", "Lewis Carroll was a great person."], ["title", "Boomerang bishops"], ["updated_at", Wed, 11 Jun 2014 16:17:42 UTC +00:00]]

Renan; a supreme artist, like Flaubert, has been able to isolate himself, to keep himself out of reach of the clamorous claims of others, to stand ‘under the shelter of the wall,’ as Plato puts it, and so to realise the perfection of what was in him, to his own incomparable gain, and to the incomparable and lasting gain of the whole world. These, however, are exceptions. \r\n\r\nThe majority of people spoil their lives by an unhealthy and exaggerated altruism – are forced, indeed, so to spoil them. They find themselves surrounded by hideous poverty, by hideous ugliness, by hideous starvation. It is inevitable that they should be strongly moved by all this. The emotions of man are stirred more quickly than man’s intelligence; and, as I pointed out some time ago in an article on the function of criticism, it is much more easy to have sympathy with suffering than it is to have sympathy with thought. \r\n\r\nAccordingly, with admirable, though misdirected intentions, they very seriously and very sentimentally set themselves to the task of remedying the evils that they see. But their remedies do not cure the disease: they merely prolong it. Indeed, their remedies are part of the disease.\r\n\r\nThey try to solve the problem of poverty, for instance, by keeping the poor alive; or, in the case of a very advanced school, by amusing the poor.\r\n"], ["updated_at", Wed, 11 Jun 2014 17:30:01 UTC +00:00]]

Renan; a supreme artist, like Flaubert, has been able to isolate himself, to keep himself out of reach of the clamorous claims of others, to stand ‘under the shelter of the wall,’ as Plato puts it, and so to realise the perfection of what was in him, to his own incomparable gain, and to the incomparable and lasting gain of the whole world.

They find themselves surrounded by hideous poverty, by hideous ugliness, by hideous starvation[^1]. It is inevitable that they should be strongly moved by all this. The emotions of man are stirred more quickly than man’s intelligence; and, as I pointed out some time ago in an article on the function of criticism, it is much more easy to have sympathy with suffering than it is to have sympathy with thought. \r\n\r\nAccordingly, with admirable, though misdirected intentions, they very seriously and very sentimentally set themselves to the task of remedying the evils that they see.

The emotions of man are stirred more quickly than man’s intelligence; and, as I pointed out some time ago in an article on the function of criticism, it is much more easy to have sympathy with suffering than it is to have sympathy with thought. \r\n\r\nAccordingly, with admirable, though misdirected intentions, they very seriously and very sentimentally set themselves to the task of remedying the evils that they see. But their remedies do not cure the disease: they merely prolong it. Indeed, their remedies are part of the disease.\r\n\r\nThey try to solve the problem of poverty, for instance, by keeping the poor alive; or, in the case of a very advanced school, by amusing the poor.\r\n\r\n[^1]: It provides additional information.\r\n[^2]: [This be a link](http://google.com \"shankar Shanti\")"], ["updated_at", Thu, 12 Jun 2014 20:51:13 UTC +00:00]]

Renan; a supreme artist, like Flaubert, has been able to isolate himself, to keep himself out of reach of the clamorous claims of others, to stand ‘under the shelter of the wall,’ as Plato puts it, and so to realise the perfection of what was in him, to his own incomparable gain, and to the incomparable and lasting gain of the whole world. These, however, are exceptions[^2]. \r\n\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass Post < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n    validates :title, presence: true, length: {minimum: 5}\r\n    has_and_belongs_to_many :categories\r\n    accepts_nested_attributes_for :categories\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe majority of people spoil their lives by an unhealthy and exaggerated altruism – are forced, indeed, so to spoil them. They find themselves surrounded by hideous poverty, by hideous ugliness, by hideous starvation[^1]. It is inevitable that they should be strongly moved by all this. The emotions of man are stirred more quickly than man’s intelligence; and, as I pointed out some time ago in an article on the function of criticism, it is much more easy to have sympathy with suffering than it is to have sympathy with thought. \r\n\r\nAccordingly, with admirable, though misdirected intentions, they very seriously and very sentimentally set themselves to the task of remedying the evils that they see. But their remedies do not cure the disease: they merely prolong it. Indeed, their remedies are part of the disease.\r\n\r\nThey try to solve the problem of poverty, for instance, by keeping the poor alive; or, in the case of a very advanced school, by amusing the poor.\r\n\r\n[^1]: It provides additional information.\r\n[^2]: [This be a link](http://google.com \"shankar Shanti\")", "picture"=>#<ActionDispatch::Http::UploadedFile:0x007f846890efb8 @tempfile=#<Tempfile:/tmp/RackMultipart20140613-38084-u3t7zv>, @original_filename="slide_4.jpg", @content_type="image/jpeg", @headers="Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"post[picture]\"; filename=\"slide_4.jpg\"\r\nContent-Type: image/jpeg\r\n">, "excerpt"=>"The chief advantage that would result from the establishment of Socialism is, undoubtedly, the fact that Socialism would relieve us from that sordid necessity of living for others which, in the present condition of things, presses so hardly upon almost everybody.
